# Web-Games

## Update

This project was previously deployed to Heroku, but I've since moved it to GitHub Pages. This migration required that I change some code like use React instead of Express for html templating. Because of this some of the tests may not work anymore, but you can view the working tests in the v1.0.0 tagged code.

## Description
